**Rule 1**
Follow the Discord Community Guidelines and Terms Of Service.

**Rule 2**
No NSFW content is allowed in the server. This is a Python server.

**Rule 3**
Don't use Racial, Homophobic or Transphobic slurs. Respect all members.

**Rule 4**
No self-bots. We have enough bots in this server. More just creates spam.

**Rule 5**
Do not try to mention @everyone, or unnecessarily ping members/roles. You should never ping members who are not present in the current discussion, unless they've previously given you permission.

**Rule 6**
Just ask your question. Dont ask if you can ask your question. 

**Rule 7**
Keep discussions relevant to channel topics.

**Rule 8**
No unapproved advertising, including requests for paid work or your discord server. You can put your project in #-finished-projects with approval.  

**Rule 9**
Do not DM members without getting their permission first. If you want coding help, use the help channels.


** Violating these rules can result in a warning or ban, depending on how annoying I find you, or how I feel on that particualr day. **
