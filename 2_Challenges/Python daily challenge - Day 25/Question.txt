** Day 25 **

In Minecraft, collected ore must be smelted in a furnace to change the resource into a usable form.
Each ingot takes 11 seconds to produce. Steve has the following fuel options to add to the furnace:

Buckets of lava, each lasts 800 seconds
Blaze rod, each lasts 120 seconds
Coals, each lasts 80 seconds
Blocks of Wood, each lasts 15 seconds
Sticks, each lasts 1 second

Write a function that calculates the minimum amount of fuel needed to produce x number of iron ingots.
