Ninjas frequently need to signal each other in code.
They often employ natural sounds as cover. 
Our ninja will chirp like a bird, with different amounts of chirps signifying different messages.
Write a python program that has signals for attack, hide and caution, using different bird sounds. 

input-output should look like:
```py
chirp(4);
    # output would be chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp.```
